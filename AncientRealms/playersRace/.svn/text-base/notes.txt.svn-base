// How to Install
// Drop the playersRace folder into your sphereserver (i.e c:/sphere/scripts/add-ons/playersRace/)
// open "spheretables.scp" found in the main script driectory /sphere/scripts/spheretables.scp
// at the end of [RESOURCES] add a new line : "scripts/scripts/add-ons/playersRace/" and save and close
// spheretables .scp, resync or boot your server and once in game and on a GM Char type ".RaceSetup"

// The playerRace folder can be downloaded from :

// To create the folder incase you cannot download it.
// Just make a new folder and name it playerRace.
// inside the playerRace folder create 10 scp files with the following names :

// raceControlSettings.scp
// raceDialogs.scp
// raceFinish.scp
// raceItems.scp
// racePlayerEvents.scp
// racePolePosition.scp
// raceQueueManagment.scp
// raceStart.scp
// raceTrackMeasurement.scp

// You will find the scripts for each of these new scp files in Reply#73 at the following link
// http://www.sphereserver.net/index.php?/topic/48923-tournament/page__pid__236386__st__80#entry236386
// in reply #73 each 'code-block' is named with the name of the SCP in which you should put it.
// remeber to make sure each script ends with [EOF] on the very last line.

// Script Settings :[DEFNAME PlayersRaceEvent]

// LineTolerance = Line Tolerance changes on how the script defines a vertical or horizontal line
//		   The Default setting is 5, increasing; increases the angle between the true vertical 
// 		   Or the true horizonal, decreasing the value brings it closer to the true V or H
//
// SuffleRandomicity = Simple increases the range of random numbers aruguably useless, default 10
// CheckPointTimer = This is the default Timer on the Check Points
// RaceBrainTimer = This controls how fast the players race dialog updates and how fast a checkpoint
//		    is activates when in range default is 11
// AutoStartTimer = This is how long it takes for the event to auto start.






// Since a race track; [Start]-----------------
//                          [End]              \
//                             \                \
//                              \               /
//                               --------------	
// is the distance travelled around the track rather than the 
// distance from the start to the end; 
// To use DISTANCE (X) points would have to be placed around the track
//
//                          X-----------------X
//                            X                \
//                             \                X
//                              \               /
//                               X-------------X
//
// so that there was something to measure from ^^
// this will require measuring the distance and placing the checkpoints around
// there maybe other options but i cant think what atm. Also adding a checkpoint
// to the start postion X has been placed so we can measure the first 'stretch' 
// of the track so we will make the check point X first.

// im starting to like this idea, because if the checkpoints a GPSTone feature
// the can self locate and inform the control stone were all the cords could be measured
// in other words you could make a track anywhere, even on in one town or the other
// lots of players running from one check point in cove to the next in britian for eg
// you could add target finders to point ther way etc etc and would have to update
// f_raceSendPlayers so that it starts them with check point in the middle of the
// group instead of corners. 37625 or use something else you can walk through and see
